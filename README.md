# Project 3 / Food-ordering-app 


- This is a food-ordering IOS mobile app for users to find restaurants and menus and place orders. It uses React Native, Firebase, Google API, and Yelp API. 

## Adding Native Code

This project can be run from a web browser or the Expo client app. You may find that you want to add more native code later on. You can do this by ejecting the project and rebuilding it yourself.

- Run `yarn eject` to create the native projects.
- You can still run your project in the web browser or Expo client, you just won't be able to access any new native modules you add.

## Publishing

- Deploy the native app to the App store and Play store using this guide: [Deployment](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/app-stores/).
- Deploy the website using this guide: [Web deployment](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/publishing-websites/).

## Future improvement

- Adding Stripe payment function
- Add a filter function based on the type of food or cuisine
- Please let me know if you have more interesting ideas.
